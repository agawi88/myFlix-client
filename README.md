In this project I will be building the client side of my application using REACT and Parcel. My app will be using the previously created movie_API.
For the moment I created a new repository called "myFlix-client", installed Parcel and build itsthe repository's file structure. Finally I tested my project using Parcel: parcel src\index.html

It can be accessed via http://localhost:1234/
