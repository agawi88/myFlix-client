In this project I will be building the client side of my movie application using REACT and Parcel and Bootstrap. My app will be using the previously created movie_API.

For the moment I created a new repository called "myFlix-client", installed Parcel and build itsthe repository's file structure. Finally I tested my project using Parcel: <b> parcel src\index.html </b>

To start the project run the following command in the Terminal: <b> npm run dev </b>

It can be accessed via http://localhost:1234/
